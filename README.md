# Kinetics datasets

Kinetics is a collection of large-scale, high-quality datasets of URL links of up to 650,000 video clips that cover 400/600/700 human action classes, depending on the dataset version. The videos include human-object interactions such as playing instruments, as well as human-human interactions such as shaking hands and hugging. Each action class has at least 400/600/700 video clips. Each clip is human annotated with a single action class and lasts around 10 seconds.

The Kinetics project publications can be found here: https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics.

Note that it may not be safe to train / test across different versions of the dataset, for example the k400 validation set is largely part of the k700 training set so results will not be meaningful.



This repo based on https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset

The original code based on wget which is too slow to download for  such a large dataset, So this new script is based on multithread aria2c which is 10x times faster than wget.

I only test the k400 script so feel free to debug other script.

# Updates

5th of May: fixed k400/train/part_120.tar.gz, it was a tar file before

10th of December: add two downloader scripts for datasets automatic setup. (**k400_downloader.sh** and **k700_2020_downloader.sh**)

13th of September. K400: replaced corrupted mountain climber validation file and made available 1300+ replacement videos for existing corrupted training videos from various classes. K600: added list of links for held out test set.

4th of August 2021 -- replaced corrupted videos in the kinetics-700-2020 test set (these were typically shorter than 9s as well). There are still 5% of the videos in the test set that are shorter than 9s, but genuinely so (e.g. because they are like that in youtube). 

# Download Videos

CVDF currently hosts the videos in the Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-700-2020 datasets.

## Dependency

Note that you should install aria2c first and put the aria2c.exe into your system Path

### Kinetics-400

#### Kinetics-400 Download:

##### Clone repo and enter directory
```
git clone https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset.git
cd kinetics-dataset
```

##### Download tar gzip files
This will create two directories, k400 and k400_targz. Tar gzips will be in k400_targz, you can delete k400_targz directory after extraction.
```
bash ./k400_download.sh
```

##### Extract tar gzip files
```
bash ./k400_extractor.sh
```

#### Kinetics-400 Info:
The train/val/test splits are subdivided into many files. The lists of links to video files can be found here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/train/k400_train_path.txt

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/val/k400_val_path.txt

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/test/k400_test_path.txt

It is easy to obtain a specific split (e.g. train), by:
```
bash download.sh k400_train_path.txt
```
Then, extract `*.tar.gz` files by:
```
bash extract.sh k400_train_path.txt
```

The links/annotations can be found under the annotation subfolders:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/annotations/val.csv

https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/400/annotations/test.csv

News: users found \~1400 corrupted videos. A replacement for the vast majority can be found here:
